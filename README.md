# ChatBot
This is a retrieval based chatbot using pattern response tags to answer queries

# Project Highlights
- A retrieval based chatbot for medical guidance from tagged patterns and responses using deep learning techniques
- Text data is preprocessed from the intents.json file by importing it and by tokenizing the patterns, further using lemmatization on the tokens and creating classes from the tags
- An RNN with LSTM layer for learning long term dependencies and achieved 99.81 % cross-validation accuracy is learnt
- A GUI application for user input queries using preprocessing query andfor generating responses or redirection.
